# circuit-simulator

This is a circuit simulation software made in Unity. This is loosly based off an old simulation software

Our changes which were requested by the client involved changing the simulation to be more realistic and in a 3D environment with interactable components

This is what our circuit simulator application now looks like. The fundamentals of connecting wires, operating a multimeter device, switch functionality and environment have all been implemented to create the start of a realistic setting where people can learn to connect electrical circuits before handling them in real-world situations. 

We hope in the future to implement scenarios consisting of specific combinaitons of components to test the user on their knowledge, as well as a feature where the user could create their own scenarios.
